# Water Spreading Algorithm | Water Spreading Algorithm Parallel
Follows the implementation of the algorithm described in "Computing shortest paths from a source node to each other node" -  Liu, Guisong et. al., and a parallel implementation that parallelizes the algorithm, using OpenMP.

The algorithm is related to the K-shortest-path problem (KSP), which is summarized in finding the k-shortest paths in a directed weighted graph in a non-decreasing order.



# Execution

1. Execute "sh compile.sh"
2. Execute "sh execute.sh"


# Parallel Version vs Sequential Version
Some images comparing both versions
